Reflection on the project:  
-------------------------------------------------------
* I am the visualizer of Group1.  
- On our way to finish the project, we had met many obstacles, most influencial ones are all technical ones: having problem saving cfg file and fluently access spread sheet on ipynb, having no experiences on data processing and graphing on ipynb.  
- we spent too long on just data curating, we get our final dataset on Saturday night.
- We had set our goal as making our project reproducible from the very beginning, so we decided to try everything on ipynb. I am not sure what exactly other group mates had been through, I had spent a hard time figuring out how to graph on ipynb, from scratch. Luckily I figured out as much as we could use to present our findings.  
- There was a small problem that one of our groupmates was out of town and basically too busy with other scheduled goals, we could not have a chance to meet everybody to discuss what each of us should be expected to complete. But luckily, again, we have pretty efficient conversations vis facebook and google handout.  
- The visualizers has a facebook group within the horizontal group, which I think is a good way to communicate; however, each of us is in a different vertical group with different speeds and defferent approaches on visualizing, we in fact can only discuss as gerneral as what plots are you guys making for your group. Also, due to time concern, I became too busy to check out how everybody else is doing in our horizontal group as later approaching the presentation date.

+  
-------  
- efficient communication within vertical group.
- understood role of each one  
- though there are a lot left for us to figure out from scratch by ourselves, we did not give up on searching and trying.  
- We had met Aaron and the GSI's, meeting and talking to them made us much clear on everything. We had many technical problems solved and become not as panic as before.

-----------------  
- should start earlier  
- should spend some time on explainning to groupmates how each part was acheived, for instance, I should explain to my groupmates how each of my code contribute to the plot so that I would not be the only one who can make modifications on the graphs, same for data curator and analyzer.  One of our goals should also be learning, so we should all know what to do with each part.  
- should plan ahead what are the expectations for each step: what final format of the data the analyzer and visualizer want from the curator, what kinds of plots the analyzer want to illustrate his findings with, how detail should all previous parts be explained so that the presenter knows which step to emphasize on, etc.
