This week, we have been working on installing vagrant. Actually I am not quit sure about what we are trying to get  
'vagrant up' to work for. I have some vague feeling that Aaron wants us to do something with tht ipython notebook with  
this 'vagrant' the the command processor. To be more honest, I have been having this vague feeling ever since we had  
touched on the virtual machine. Because I am not a CS major, and I think many of us aren't either, I don't have enough  
basic knowledge about computers. So sometimes I was not able to follow the ideas fluently, such as how to use ** software  
to help us build a *** environment which allows group contributions towards the same project. I know this sentence sounds  
non-sense, but that is the best I tried to catch. Regarding to my difficulty of catching the objectives, I hope we can  
have more clearly explained objectives so that I can have basic ideas about what we are aiming for and what a specific  
step will help us achieve the objective. And I also think it would be also helpful if we could have more clear  
instructions on each step. If so, we will be more clear about whether we have done the stpes correstly.  

Something that I like regarding this week is the way that we have our groups set up.
