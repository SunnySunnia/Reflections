Our group had discussed our goals and tasks for the rest of the semester, as we were asked to fill out the group evaluation sheet. For this week, since we were still not completely clear about Luen's code of how to compute error diagrams, we had decided that we would figure out our own algorithm to compare the models. Our thought was even though we will still try to figure out Luen's trick, we should not rely completely on waiting for Luen's expanation. So we did start trying and also asked if the Analyzer group 2 had developed the algorithm already. While waiting for analyzers' response, we found out that we were not able to ask our algorithm to vary tao on the x-axis of the error diagram for one specific window function. We had been trapped into this roadblock until the conference call with Luen. He said once he looked back on his code and clear everything out, he will write us back. So hopefully we will be able to vary window functions on top of Luen's code and compare between models with error diagrams and area under those curves.  

While we are still waiting, our group figure out a new direction. Similar to the optimization approach, we simply gather all the times of first successors of earthquakes that are larger that magnitude 3 within an increment of 0.1, then we find thier 90 percentile cut points as our window length for earthquakes within that magnitude range. Or to be a little more rigorous, we may fit a window function on the cut points.
