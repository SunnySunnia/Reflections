This week, our group presented the plots of ECDF's of each magnitude range and tested on tuning the parameter u in Luen's code. We also produced plots of successors' arrival times after each event.  

I also went to Prof. Stark's OH and gained many thoughts on guessing a function for window length depended on magnitude. I will first share with my group and try to go a little bit deeper on that, then we will present on Tuesday what we have done.  

In terms of the whole course, I feel that it is getting more and more interesting because I start to see real progress on this project.
