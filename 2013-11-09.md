For this week's reflection, first I would like to say we made a lot of progress in terms of making clear of our final goals, decomposing project into tasks for groups, seting clear timeline for the whole project, and completing tasks for last stage.  

By now, we have our detailed proposal for each week which I think will save us a lot of time when we are collaborating within our own subgroups.  

As much as I am looking forward to get this project finished successfully, I also regularly check out how other groups are doing and how may their work help ours. I found that github sharing and massaging becomes more and more helpful.
